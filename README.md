Library for automatic pyrolysis data interpretation.

Includes such features as:
* Detection of organic matter types;
* Estimation of oil and gas windows intervals;
* Plotting: all common plot types, used for data interpretation are available;
* Curve approximation for common and not so common variants (also user defined);
* Interactive session using the Streamlit interface in the browser;
* Visualization of data points on the map when coordinates are provided and other mapping tools;

Experimental features:
* Machine Learning for data imputation (eg. construct a model to predict TOC on a number of other parameters such as XY-location, depositional environment and others);
* Chart digitizer for custom user loaded plots;
